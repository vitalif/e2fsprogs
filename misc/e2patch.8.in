.B e2patch
applies and restores "patches" produced by e2fsprogs with patch file option
(\fBresize2fs -T <patch_file>\fR) to block devices.
.PP
"Patch files" are sparse files containing overwritten device blocks and
a block bitmap.

"Patch files" are faster, safer and simpler to use than "undo files"
(\fBe2undo\fR and \fBresize2fs -z <undo_file>\fR), even though their original
design goal is similar.
